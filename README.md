# NeetpiqWebApp

This is a sample web app created from the following tutorial:
    [Quickstart: Create an ASP.NET Core web app in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet)
    In this quickstart, you'll learn how to create and deploy your first ASP.NET Core web app to [Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview).

I will use it as a container for my proof of concepts for experimenting purposes.

This app has been deployed to Azure App Service using DevOps as CI/CD environment.
